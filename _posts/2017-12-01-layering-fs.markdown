In this lab, we will look at how layering filesystems work. Its no magic at all ...

## <a name="task0"></a>Task 0: Prerequisites

First lets create some directories, and files
```.term1
    mkdir -p  /var/lib/docker/overlay2/hack
    cd $_
    mkdir -p lower upper work merge
    echo original text > lower/one.txt
    alias ll='ls -la'
```

Lets mount an overlay fs:
```.term1
    mount -v -t overlay -o lowerdir=$PWD/lower,upperdir=$PWD/upper,workdir=$PWD/work  none $PWD/merge
    find .
```

Unmount
```.term1
    umount $PWD/merge
````


### Make sure you have a DockerID

If you do not have a DockerID (a free login used to access Docker Cloud, Docker Store, and Docker Hub), please visit [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com) and register for one. You will need this for later steps.

## <a name="Task_1"></a>Task 1: Play with alpine

1. Run the following command in your Linux console, to pull alpine image

```.term1
    docker pull alpine
```

Lets see whats in an image:
```.term1
    docker save alpine | tar -xv
```

Extract the alpine FS into a dir:

```.term1
    mkdir alpine
    cd $_
    tar -xf ../*/layer.tar
    cd ..
```

Lest mount lower+alpine into merge:

```.term1
    mount -v -t overlay -o lowerdir=$PWD/lower:$PWD/alpine,upperdir=$PWD/upper,workdir=$PWD/work  none $PWD/merge
    ll merge
```
## <a name="Task_2"></a>Task 2: Learn chroot

In this step you'll learn how to use chroot


1. Make sure you're in the `linux_tweet_app` directory.

```.term1
    cd ~/linux_tweet_app
```

2. Exit from chroot

```.term1
    exit
````
